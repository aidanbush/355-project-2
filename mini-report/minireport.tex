\subsection*{Minmax Implementation}
In our approach we will use Alpha-Beta pruning with iterative deepening.
Iterative deepening is used so that we are able better work within the time limit and explore more of a breadth of possible moves.
We will also be sorting potential moves in order of highest to lowest for our MAX function and visa versa for our MIN function.

\subsection*{Evaluation Function}

\subsection*{Representation of State Space}
To represent our state space we will use an array of 8 16bit integers.
Every two bits is a square on the board, such that a single 16bit integer is an entire row 1-8.
Every 2 bits will be the a-h entries for the specific row they are part of.
We are using this model to reduce our overall memory usage.
This memory model should increase the speed of the program as it will have to access less memory.
% TODO add more and figure
